## Why❔

Traditional medical records are often centralized and susceptible to tampering. StarkCare leverages StarkNet's low-cost computation and high TPS to create an immutable, on-chain record of medical procedures, all while offering a superior user experience.

## 🎨 Enhanced UX Design 🎨

We've put a strong emphasis on user experience, making it easier than ever for both healthcare providers and patients to interact with the platform.
